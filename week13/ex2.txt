Prevention:
The program is designed to have no deadlocks. It is the most difficult approach to implement, practically impossible to reach, but it offers the best performance.

Recovery:
This strategy tries to solve the occurred deadlock. The simplest way to implement is to kill a process. But such approach is dangerous and unstable.

Avoidance:
This strategy is the safest option. It is easier to implement than prevention strategy, but worse in performance. The idea lies in prediction of a deadlock and manipulation of resources. Such precalculation results in relatively poor performance.
