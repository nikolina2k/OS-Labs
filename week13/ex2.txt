Prevention:
Designing the program to have no deadlocks. The approach is almost impossible to implement but it offers best performance.

Recovery:
Solving the occurred deadlock by killing the process for example. The approach is dangerous and unstable.

Avoidance:
It is the safest strategy and the easiest to implement but is worse in performance. The idea is in the prediction of the deadlock which results in poor performance.
