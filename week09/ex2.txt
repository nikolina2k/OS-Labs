Increase: There can be repeated page numbers for a high hit/miss rate. Example: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

Decrease: There can be unique numbers of pages for a low hit/miss rate. In this case, there won't be any hits because every page will happen once and always miss. Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
